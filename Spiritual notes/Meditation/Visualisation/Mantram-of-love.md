Visualisation Exercise:

 Then look out, in your imagination, over the world of men. See that world as one of light, with here and there intensifications of the light in certain localities or centres or areas.

a. Then imagine this web of light with its radiant centres of force as pulsating to the rhythm of the world aspiration.

b. Regard yourself then as the onlooker, but also as a channel, among the many channels, for the energy of the spiritual Hierarchy, focussed for you through the Master Morya, and stepped down to you through me, your Tibetan brother.

c. Use then the set of phrases which embody your aspiration and which appears in your replies:

"Love is the incentive of our aspiration on the Path;
Love is the substance of our living in the world.
Love is the light and height of freedom for all living creatures;
Love pulses through the universe in a divine rhythm.
Love is the consciousness of God."
d. Imagine, as you do this, that the energy of love is pouring through the web of light, stimulating each of the many, many centres into greater radiance.

3. Then sound the O.M. breathing it forth into the personality.

4. Next, do some mental work in meditation, holding the mind steady in the light; carry your service in my group and any other aspect of your work in the world into that light, seeing it all as part of the one great service. For you, intercession is peculiarly useful, for it tends to promote understanding.

5. Seek then to get in touch with your group brothers, holding them too, as a group, in the light.

If you so desire, on two days in the week, you can follow any meditation which you find useful and helpful. I seek to leave you free.
