The first symbol we need to present is this: 

Stage IV:
	*==Into the dark the life proceeds.  A different voice seems to sound forth.  "Enter the cave and find your own; walk in the dark and on your head carry a lighted lamp.  The cave is dark and lonely; cold is it and a place of many sounds and voices.  The voice of the many sons of God, left playing on the playground of the Lord, make their appeal for light.  The cave is long and narrow.  The air is full of fog.  The sound of running water meets the rushing sound of wind, and frequent roll of thunder.==*

Far off, dim and most vaguely seen, appears an oval opening, its color blue.  Stretched athwart this space of blue, a rosy cross is seen, and at the centre of the cross, where four arms meet, a rose.  Upon the upper limb, a vibrant diamond shines, within a star five-pointed.

The living soul drives forward towards the cross which bars his way to life, revealed and known.

Not yet the cross is mounted and therefore left behind.  But onward goes the living soul, eyes fixed upon the cross, ears open to the wailing cries of all his brother souls.

Stage V:
Out into radiant life and light!  The cave is left behind; the cross is overturned; the way stands clear.  The word sounds clear within the head and not within the heart.  "Enter again the playground of the Lord and this time lead the games."  The way upon the second tier of stairs stands barred, this by the soul's own act.  No longer red desire governs all the life, but now the clear blue flame burns strong.  Upon the bottom step of the barred Way he turns back and passes down the stairs on to the playground, meeting dead shells built in an earlier stage, stepping upon forms discarded and destroyed, and holding forth the hands of helpfulness.  Upon his shoulder sits the bird of peace; upon his feet the sandals of the messenger.

Not yet the utter glory of the radiant life!  Not yet the entering into everlasting peace!  But still the work, and still the lifting of the little ones.

Here in symbolic form we have pictures of human life and progress, of life in form and growing through the building process which marks the creative work.  It is only a bald translation of some mantric phrases, and of some basic symbols, and must in no way be considered to be anything except indicative of a process, veiled and couched so that only those who know can understand.  Esotericists will understand that these five stages cover the life period of every form, no matter whether the creator is cosmic, planetary or human.

Every form is built by an impulsive spark of life, emanated by a creator, and growing stage by stage under the law of accretion—an aspect of the law of attraction, which is the law of life.  This law cooperates with the Law of Cause and Effect, which, as we know, is the law governing matter.  Cause, attraction or desire, accretion and effect—these four words govern the construction of any thought-form.  When the latter is a completed entity, it is an effect built by accretion under the power of an organised cause.

The race has evolved now to a point where we think of effects primarily  in terms of quality rather than in terms of matter.  A thought-form exists for us in order  to produce an effect.  The raison d'être of all forms we have come to feel is to express some subjective quality which will give us the key to its creator's purpose.  Ponder on these words.  Hence, we find in this Rule XI that the purpose of the word pronounced is to tell the lives which constitute the form "what to do and where to carry that which has been made."  Thus we find the idea of purpose, activity and goal.

There is no need for me to add to the vast amount of literature which has been put forth or to emphasise the significance of purpose in connection with such a thought form as a solar system, a planet, a kingdom in nature or a human being.  In some respects this subjective triplicity of purpose, activity and goal is well known and in others it is of too high and too inscrutable a nature for us to deal with in these Instructions and wander into the realms of speculation.  With the goal, religion has long sought to deal; with the activity aspect, the scientist is now attempting to deal; and with the Will of God the most advanced thinkers and philosophers are constantly speculating.  Only when man submits himself to the discipline of his own spiritual will and controls the activity of the lives within his form nature and so orients himself to the goal as it progressively makes its appeal to his vision, will he arrive at a true understanding of the plan, which constitutes the will of God as far as human beings can grasp it.

But with the thought-forms which he is beginning to create as he daily learns to think, we can concern ourselves for it is the first lesson soon to be learnt in the magical work.  The creator in mental matter has:

a. To learn to build intelligently.
b. To give the impulse, through right speech which will animate that which he has built, and so enable the thought-form to convey the intended idea.

c. To send out his thought-form correctly oriented to his goal, and so truly directed that it will reach the objective and accomplish its sender's purpose.

The necessity for clear thinking and the elimination of idle, destructive and negative thoughts becomes increasingly apparent as the aspirant progresses upon his way.  As the power of the mind increases and as the human being differentiates his thought increasingly from mass thought, he inevitably builds thought substance into form.  It is at first automatic and unconscious.  He cannot help so doing, and fortunately, for the race, the forms constructed are so feeble that they are largely innocuous, or so in line with mass thought that they are negligible in their effect.  But as man evolves his power and his capacity to harm or to help increases, and unless he learns to build rightly and correctly to motivate that which he has built he will become a destructive agency and a centre of harmful force—destroying and harming not only himself, as we shall see shortly, but equally hurting and harming those who vibrate to his note.

Granted all this you might appositely inquire: Are there some simple rules which the earnest and sincere beginner could apply to this science of building and which are so clear and concise that they will produce the needed effect?  There are, and I will state them simply so that the beginner will, if he follows them, escape the dangers of black magic, and learn to build in line with the plan.  He will, if he follows the rules I give, avoid the intricate problem which he has himself blindly constructed and which will indeed shut out the light of day, darken his world, and imprison him in a wall of forms which will embody for him his own peculiar great illusion.

These rules may sound too simple for the learned aspirant but for those who are willing to become as little children they will be found to be a safe guide into truth  and will eventually make them able to pass the tests for adeptship.  Some are couched in terms symbolic, others are necessarily blinds, still others express the truth just as it is.

1. View the world of thought, and separate the false out of the true.

2. Learn the meaning of illusion, and in its midst locate the golden thread of truth.

3. Control the body of emotion for the waves that rise upon the stormy seas of life engulf the swimmer, shut out the sun and render all plans futile.

4. Discover that thou hast a mind and learn its dual use.

5. Concentrate the thinking principle, and be the master of thy mental world.

6. Learn that the thinker and his thought and that which is the means of thought are diverse in their nature, yet one in ultimate reality.

7. Act as the thinker, and learn it is not right to prostitute thy thought to the base use of separative desire.

8. The energy of thought is for the good of all and for the furtherance of the Plan of God.  Use it not therefore for thy selfish ends.

9. Before a thought-form is by thee constructed, vision its purpose, ascertain its goal, and verify the motive.

10. For thee, the aspirant on the way of life, the way of conscious building is not yet the goal.  The work of cleaning out the atmosphere of thought, of barring fast the doors of thought to hate and pain, to fear, and jealousy and low desire, must first precede the conscious work of building.  See to thy aura, oh traveller on the way.

11. Watch close the gates of thought.  Sentinel desire. Cast out all fear, all hate, all greed.  Look out and up.

12. Because the life is mostly  centered on the plane of concrete life, thy words and speech will indicate thy thought.  To these pay close attention.

13. Speech is of triple kind.  The idle words will each produce effect.  If good and kind, naught need be done.  If otherwise, the paying of the price cannot be long delayed.

The selfish words, sent forth with strong intent, build up a wall of separation.  Long time it takes to break that wall and so release the stored-up, selfish purpose.  See to thy motive, and seek to use those words which blend the little life with the large purpose of the will of God.

The word of hate, the cruel speech which ruins those who feel its spell, the poisonous gossip, passed along because it gives a thrill—these words kill the flickering impulses of the soul, cut at the roots of life, and so bring death.

If spoken in the light of day, just retribution will they bring; when spoken and then registered as lies, they strengthen that illusory world in which the speaker lives and holds him back from liberation.

If uttered with intent to hurt, to bruise and kill, they wander back to him who sent them forth and him they bruise and kill.

14. The idle thought, the selfish thought, the cruel hateful thought if rendered into word produce a prison, poison all the springs of life, lead to disease, and cause disaster and delay.  Therefore, be sweet and kind and good as far as in thee lies.  Keep silence and the light will enter in.

15. Speak not of self.  Pity not thy fate.  The thoughts of self and of thy lower destiny prevent the inner voice of thine own soul from striking upon thine ear.  Speak of the soul; enlarge upon the plan; forget thyself in building for the world.  Thus is the law of form offset.  Thus can the rule of love enter upon that world.

These simple rules will lay right foundations for the carrying forward of the magical work, and will render the mental body so clear and so powerful that right motive will control and true work in building will be possible.

Much of the significance of this rule must remain theoretical, and be considered as holding a challenge until such time as the real magical work of thought-form building becomes universally possible.  The formula, as we have seen, will remain unknown to all save the members of the Hierarchy of Adepts for long ages to come.  The directional words are capable of ascertainment, but only to those who are working consciously under the guidance of their own souls, and who, through mind control merging into deep meditation, can manipulate the matter of thought and become "knowing creators."  These can, and do, speak the impulsive words which bring into being those new forms and organisms, those expressions of ideas and those organisations which live their life cycle and serve their purpose, and so come, duly, to their timely and appointed end.  These creators are the leaders and organisers, the teachers and the guides in all phases of human living.  Their sound does go forth into all lands and their note is internationally recognised.  Hundreds of such names are easily remembered and spring unhidden to the mind.  They live in the memory of the multitude and that which lives is the sound of  their accomplishment, be that good or bad.

But in the sentence which we must consider we find portrayed a universal function, even though it is as yet carried forward for the most part unconsciously.  The words to be dealt with are as follows:

III. Finally, to utter forth the mystic phrase which will save him from their work.
