**_This document draws on Alice Bailey's insightful observations in the book From Intellect to Intuition._**

Bailey presents meditation not as a single technique but as a **progressive path of consciousness**. The five types are:

1. **Exoteric Meditation (Intellectual/Concrete Thought)**
   - **Focuses** on form, symbols, and external objects.
   - **The mind analyses and categorises**, remaining bound to the three worlds of human experience.
   - **Purpose:** to train the mental apparatus and establish discipline.

2. **Symbolic Meditation**
   - **Moves beyond the form** to grasp the idea behind the symbol.
   - The student begins to perceive meaning and subjective reality.
   - Purpose: to awaken abstract thought and link the mind with the soul.

3. **Subjective Meditation**
   - The meditator consciously contacts the soul itself.
   - Ideas are no longer abstract but become living energies.
   - Purpose: to unfold soul qualities and work with subtle forces.

4. **Creative Meditation**
   - The soul’s energy is used to **create and manifest** ideas into form.
   - The meditator becomes a conscious cooperator with divine evolution.
   - Purpose: to train people to work in mental matter and become creators aligned with higher plans.

5. **Intuitional Meditation**
   - The culmination: direct perception of truth without symbols or intermediaries.
   - The mind is transcended; pure intuition and illumination guide the consciousness.
   - Purpose: to establish union with the universal mind and participate in divine purpose.

This appears as the simple evolutionary progression of meditation. It may be worth comparing it to the eastern
perception of the same progression, using the lense of Patanjali.

| **Bailey’s Meditation Type**  | **Patanjali’s Vritti Connection** | **Interpretation**                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Exoteric (intellectual focus) | Pramāṇa & Vikalpa                 | Mind works with valid knowledge but also imagination; discipline needed. |
| Symbolic (idea behind form)   | Viparyaya → Pramāṇa               | Moving from misconception to right knowledge by penetrating symbols.     |
| Subjective (soul contact)     | Smṛti purified                    | Memory becomes a channel for soul impressions, not personal residues.    |
| Creative (manifesting ideas)  | Vikalpa transformed               | Imagination becomes constructive, aligned with higher purpose.           |
| Intuitional (direct truth)    | Beyond vrittis                    | Stillness of mind; intuition transcends fluctuations, pure awareness.    |

This is after the table, and meditation notes progress here.

**Five stages of meditation:**

- _**Concentration:**_ This is the act of concentrating the mind, learning to focus it and so use it.
- _**Meditation:**_ The prolonged focussing of the attention in any direction and steady holding the Mind
  on any desired idea.
- _**Contemplation**_: An activit of the soul, detached from the mind, which is held in a state of quiescence.
- _**Illumination:**_ This is the result of the three preceding processes, involves the carrying down to the brain
  consciousness of the knowledge acieved.
- _**Inspiration**_: The result of illumination, as it demonstrates in the life of service.
