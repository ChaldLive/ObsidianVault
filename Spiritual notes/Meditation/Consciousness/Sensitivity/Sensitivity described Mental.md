Consciousness defined.

Consciousness is a lifeform's response to a sensed reality.

A mature understanding of sensitivity—not merely as an emotional trait of the personality, but as an intrinsic quality of consciousness itself—is essential. It reminds us that the mind is not a blunt analytical tool but a finely tuned, sensitive instrument within the spiritual equipment, capable of registering subtler impressions when rightly attuned. This is why Alice Bailey and the Tibetan teacher repeatedly stress the cultivation of an agile, responsive, and adaptable mind, one capable of receiving higher impressions with clarity and precision. Developing the capacity to recognise and interpret hierarchical impressions with discernment is a long, exacting discipline, and it tests every student of the higher wisdom.

Mingyur Rinpoche, the Nepalese meditation teacher, speaks of this process as “becoming friends with the monkey mind.” The Tibetans use this term because of the mind’s habitual tendency to leap restlessly from one object to another—a challenge familiar to aspirants in every era.

Patanjali, the Indian sage and author of the Yoga Sutras, expressed the same truth in his renowned aphorism: “yogaś citta-vṛtti-nirodhaḥ.” In The Light of the Soul, Alice Bailey offers a detailed commentary on this sutra, often rendered as: “Yoga is the quieting of the mind’s movements, allowing the true Self to be heard or seen.” Your exploration of sensitivity touches the very heart of this teaching, for sensitivity—rightly understood—is the foundation upon which true spiritual perception rests.

Sensitivity of the personality:

- Physical sensing — the ordinary sensory apparatus
- Psychological sensing — impressions, meanings, values
- Intuitive sensing — direct apprehension of principles or archetypes
