The [Elementals](The Colors of Devas) of the Ethers.

We will consider now the etheric levels of the physical plane or the four highest sub planes of the physical plane.  These etheric levels are but gradations of physical plane matter of a rarer and more refined kind, but physical nevertheless. They are termed in most textbooks:
	1. The first ether, or atomic matter.
	2. The second ether, or sub-atomic matter.
	3. The third ether, or super-etheric matter.
	4. The fourth ether, or simply etheric matter.

The fourth ether is the only one as yet recognised by scientists, and is the subject of their present investigations, little though they may realise it.

On the atomic sub-plane are the permanent physical atoms of all humanity and the appropriated atoms of the deva kingdom.  The devas do not develop as do the human race.  They reincarnate in groups, and not as individuals, though each group is composed of units, and has nothing of the nature of the involutionary group soul.  The group soul on the involutionary path and that upon the evolutionary are unlike; one is passing on to differentiation and is composed of entities animated by one general life; the other has differentiated, and each entity is a separate unit of the one life, complete in itself, yet one with the whole.

There are many types of life to be contacted on the four etheric levels, but we can only concern ourselves at present with the deva life, remembering that the deva evolution is of equal importance to that of the human.  These devas are many in number, are of involutionary and evolutionary nature, and of all grades and types.  Ruling over them on the physical plane is the great deva Kshiti.  He is a deva of rank and power equal to a Chohan of a Ray; He presides over everything outside the human kingdom upon the physical plane, and He has for His council the four subordinate deva lords of the four etheric levels.  He, with these subordinate devas, presides over a subsidiary council of seven devas who handle all that concerns the deva evolution, and the work of the greater and the lesser builders.

The deva Ruler of the fourth, or lowest ether, has delegated a member of His council to meet with certain of the Masters at this time for two specific purposes, first, to see whether the approximation of the two lines of evolution, human and deva, might be now tentatively permitted, and, secondly, to reveal some of the methods of healing and the causes of physical disability which are inherent in the etheric double.

Devas of all kinds and colours are found on the physical etheric levels, but the prevailing [^1]hue is violet, hence the term so often employed, the "devas of the shadows."  With the coming in of the ceremonial ray of violet, we have the amplification therefore of the violet vibration, always inherent on these levels, and the great opportunity therefore for contact between the two kingdoms.  It is in the development of etheric vision (which is a capacity of the physical human eye) and not in clairvoyance that this mutual apprehension will become possible.  With the coming in likewise of this ray will arrive those who belong thereon, with a natural gift of seeing etherically.  Children will frequently be born who will see etherically as easily as the average human being sees physically; as conditions of harmony gradually evolve out of the present world chaos, devas and human beings will meet as friends.



As the two planes, astral and physical, merge and blend, and continuity of consciousness is experienced upon the two, it will be difficult for human beings to differentiate at first between devas of the astral plane, and those of the physical.  At the beginning of this period of recognition, men will principally contact the violet devas, for those of the higher ranks amongst them are definitely making the attempt to contact the human.  These devas of the shadows are of a dark purple on the fourth etheric level, of a lighter purple, much the same colour as violet, on the third etheric level, a light violet on the second, whilst on the atomic subplane they are of a glorious translucent lavender.

Some of the groups of devas to be contacted on the physical plane are as follows:
