Morning meditation:
This morning meditation was mainly scoped by the emotional plane and all its pitfalls, and its capacity of keeping one at the kama-manasic of monkey brain. I strive to make my daily morning meditation an initiatory ritual, sounding forth a sound and healthy approach towards the energies surfacing today, as a result of my interactions with my fellow men.
