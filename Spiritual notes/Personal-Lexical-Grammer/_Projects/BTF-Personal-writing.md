Meditation report Outline 

Write about the spiritual climate in Europe, diving into the rise of reactionary forces and why this time is so challenging, and is causing this to happen. 
- The Danish government has called for spiritual reinforcement. Why on earth is this necessary?
- Remigration and why right-wing politicians neglect the fact that Europe, as a colonial power, played a significant role in the current refugee crisis sweeping across Europe? Don't forget that Neo fascism is on the rise in Italy, Germany and France. I am deliberately not mentioning GB; however, Nigel Farage is doing this job to perfection.
- Dark clouds are rising, and we did not expect that living in the naive, and no one dares to oppose them. We know that neo-fascist tendencies are fueled by ignorance and misinterpretation.
