Carsten, this is going to be _fun_.  
You’re not learning “English prepositions.”  
You’re learning **esoteric vectors** — the directional forces that shape how consciousness moves in language.

Below is a clean, powerful starter‑set you can drop straight into your Obsidian vault.  
Each pattern includes:

- the **preposition**,
    
- the **energetic function**,
    
- and a **usable example** in the style you’re writing.
    

Let’s build you a toolkit worthy of the work you’re doing.

# 🌟 If you want, I can help you expand this into a full Obsidian vault structure

I can build:

- a **preposition → energetic function** table
    
- example sentences for each
    
- cross‑links between planes, vehicles, and prepositional vectors
    
- a “direction of energy” map you can use when writing metaphysical texts
    

Just say the word and I’ll help you shape the next layer.
